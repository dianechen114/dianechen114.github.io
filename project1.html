              <p>
                People want an efficient way to keep track of prayer requests.

           <section class="solution">
              <h3>Solution</h3>
              <p>
                Design an app that allows people to quickly jot down a prayer request with the ability to organize later.

              <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
              <p>
                Prayermate acts as a prayer hub and partners with organizations to integrate prayer diaries and lists so users can subscribe to other online content. One drawback of Prayermate is the inefficient amount of steps it takes to write a prayer. Echo exists to help integrate prayer into a daily routine for busy people, offering features like reminders to pray, but lacks the ability to organize content.

              <p>From these User Personas I was able to create some user stories and I mapped out the top 5 user stories into flows:</p>
              <ul>
                 <li>- I want to quickly create an entry</li>
                 <li>- I want to create a subject</li>
                 <li>- I want to create a category</li>
                 <li>- I want to look back at past entries</li>

              <h3>Sketches</h3>
                 <p class="wireframe">Screens that were necessary to complete each user flow were first sketched by hand. The app would have three pages: Drafts, Cards, and Categories. On the bottom right is a floating action button that would allow users to easily add an entry.</p>

           <section class="wireframes">
              <h3>Wireframes</h3>
               <p>I made one major change when I turned my sketches into wireframes in Figma. Instead of having one primary function, the floating action button was turned into a general action button whose function would adapt to the page that the user was on. I did this for a cleaner, more cohesive look.</p>

           <section class="branding">
              <h3>Branding & Identity</h3>
              <p>
                After the wireframes were approved I started working on the brand. Parakaleo is the greek word for comfort or exhort, a word found in the bible verse Hebrews 3:13: “Exhort one another daily…“. The mountain icon was inspired by Psalm 121:1: “I lift my eyes to the hills, where does my help come from…”. These verses are the heart behind the app, which is praying and caring for one another and acknowledging we need help because things are often out of our control. Purple can be associated with spirituality and meditation and it also stands apart from Prayermate, whose colors are yellow, black, and white, and Echo, who has a teal green gradient and white color palette. Raleway and Lato pair really nicely together and are praised by the design community for its legibility.

              <p>
                The brand styles were applied to the wireframes to create high fidelity mockups

              <h3>User Testing</h3>
              <p>
                Users were asked to complete tasks that would confirm whether or not the user flows would work and determine if the changing floating action button design would make sense to users. While a majority of the tasks were easy to complete, there were some important changes that needed to be made.
              </p>
              <p>
                Having the word “Drafts” and “Entries” on the same page was confusing. Users didn’t know if they were creating an entry or a draft. Without the little prompts, the button’s action wasn’t clear to users when they were on a different screen. Especially because it would change according to the page it was on. It was frustrating for users when I asked them to add an entry to their personal card. They didn’t know where to click. After a while they clicked “Sue” and not “My Card”. So it was clear there were changes that needed to be made. I took out “My Card”. I decided to try my original sketched design.

           <section class="preference">
              <h3>Preference Test</h3>
              <p>
                I couldn’t decide which button style to choose so I did some preference testing. My next dilemma was the other icons are square so I was deciding between making it a circle to have it stand out or making it a square to keep the consistency.
