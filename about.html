                   <p>When I was around 4 or 5, I came up with my first invention: A car that you could sleep in. You might be thinking “Well anyone can sleep in a car…” and that’s true, but mine had a foldaway bed under the seats, a hideaway flip up toilet, and a tv. I was disheartened to learn that someone else had already invented the RV. Fortunately, that didn’t stop me from dreaming up new ideas or discourage me from creating.</p>
                   <p>Design has always been an integral part of my life but I never thought to pursue design as a career. I didn’t think I was creative or original enough to produce something worthwhile. Helping people was something I was always passionate about. I consistently scored high on empathy in every personality test I took. It was pretty life changing for me to realize that the heart of design is empathy. Designers need to know, understand, and relate to people in order to develop meaningful and helpful solutions for them.</p>
                   <p>There are a lot of problems in the world, big and small. Likewise, there are many potential  solutions to those problems. My goal as a designer is to understand people so I can create solutions that might make their lives a little better.</p>
