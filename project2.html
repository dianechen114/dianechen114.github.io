              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>
                In recent years, more and more bus lines have added the Washington & State bus stop to their route. Bus riders don’t have an accurate way of knowing which bus is pulling up to the stop and they don’t know how much time they have until their bus arrives.

              <h3>Solution</h3>
              <p>
                Design a mobile app screen that provides the Washington & State bus stop information such as the next arriving bus, how much time is left until it arrives, bus frequency, and live updates.

              <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
              <p>
                Google Maps is a transit app developed by Google to utilize Google’s impressive database of information. Moovit is designed for people who take multiple forms of public transportation and provides schedules and directions. Moovit and Google Maps do well to help people navigate from station to station but they fail to provide the necessary information for people while they are at the station. This is where BusyBus can enter the market. BusyBus can be the app that helps travelers find the correct bus while they are at the station or stop and prevents them from traveling in the wrong direction.

                 <p class="wireframe">My focus for this project was to design one screen but I created a three-screen paper wireframe prototype for testing purposes. The first screen shows all the local transit systems based on zip code: 92618 and the next screen lists the bus stops. The final screen provides the Washington & State bus stop information. This is the screen I worked on.</p>

              <h3>User Testing</h3>
              <p>The user testing portion helped to clarify how users currently understand and interact with the solution screen. One key takeaway from user testing was the need for labels or headers to explain the information better. Some users thought the bus number was a freeway route and the arrival time was the total trip duration.</p>

              <h3>Visual Design Evolution</h3>
              <p>After gathering all this data and feedback from users, I drafted some high fidelity mockups in Figma. They were designed for Android users so I followed the Material Design Guidelines. A header was added to resolve the issue discovered in user testing. I dialed back on the casual use of colors because color should play a more functional role, like alerts. Lastly the circle was made larger to account for more characters.</p>

              <h3>Hifi Mockup</h3>
              <p>I realized it would be difficult to predetermine how many characters would be necessary as there are so many different transit systems so I took away the bus number circular background. A horizontal line was added to divide the content into smaller chunks, making it easier to look at and establishing a clear visual hierarchy.</p>

              <h3>Coded Prototype</h3>
              <p>As the project moved into the next phase, I was provided a pdf with more information to implement into my design. The client also wanted a working prototype. I adapted my design to include the information presented to me and I created a prototype using HTML and CSS. I incorporated the style of the design but changed the content. However, the new prototype did not actually solve the initial problem of not knowing when the next bus would arrive so I redesigned the prototype to include the estimated time of arrival. Since all the information was set up in columns, it was redundant to keep repeating “Line”, “Destination”, “Frequency”, “Arriving In” so I made those headers. Knowing the frequency of the bus does not address the problem so I used italics and a smaller font size to de-emphasize its importance.</p>

              <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
              <p>Working on BusyBus helped to further bridge the world of designers and developers for me. I started with a stronger background in visual design so front-end development was a new, but exciting challenge. For this project, I played both the role of designer and developer and left the coding for the end. Moving forward as a designer, I would want to be in constant communication with the developers throughout the duration of a project because their input is so valuable and I now have a newfound appreciation for their contributions.</p>
