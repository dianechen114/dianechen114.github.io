              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>The cloud storage organization market is filled with many big name competitors such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and Evernote. With the ever-growing list of features, it can be overwhelming or even distracting trying to accomplish a simple task efficiently through these services. The storage size is also not ideal for individuals who work with video and image files.
              </p>
           </section>
           <section class="solution">
              <h3>Solution</h3>
              <p>Hive surveyed several people on how they approached organization, cloud-based storage, and productivity. This research highlighted the three key features that now make up Hive: Create, Upload, and Share. These features combined with a larger storage capacity than competitors’ appeal to individuals who work with a variety of file types.

              <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
              <p>Google Drive has a suite of free applications that work in conjunction with each other, which is great for desktop users but mobile users must download each individual app. Evernote has impressive content saving capabilities but the content creation is limited to documents and recordings. Pinterest shines in the visual department of cloud storage, but that also means their primary method of categorizing is reliant on visuals rather than text.</p>

              <p>Developing the user personas helped us determine which user stories would make up the MVP:</p>
              <ul>
                 <li>- I want to create spreadsheets, documents, and notes.</li>
                 <li>- I want to share a group of items.</li>
                 <li>- I want to upload various types files: documents, images, PDFs, videos.</li>
                 <li>- I want to collaborate on projects in real-time.</li>

              <h3>Branding & Identity</h3>
              <p>The original frontrunner for the brand name was “Tabs” because it was relevant, easy to remember, simple, and no nonsense. However, the survey demographics show that Hive should be targeted toward young professionals working in the health or tech industry, potentially in a graduate program. After revisiting the user personas built from the survey results, it made sense to go a different direction, something more fun and personable. Bees have this innate sense of organization that shows in their colony structure and honey production. The hive is simply an enclosure that the bees work within, which embodies the spirit of this cloud storage platform.</p>

Preference testing helped determine the final home page and button styles.</p>

              <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
              <p>
                 Hive had a specific market that they wanted to tap into and introduce a new product. I was brought on to research competitors, find an untapped space, establish a vision and identity for the brand, and carry out the entire design process from drawn out sketches to high fidelity working prototypes. Some key takeaways of this design process:
              </p>
              <br>
              <p class="strong">Listen to the data and the user, not just your gut.</p><br>
              <p>Even though I discovered users were only utilizing a fraction of the features offered, during the design process, I felt like the product looked too simple and didn’t offer enough features. It helped to review the survey results and the user personas to revisit exactly who I was designing this app for.</p>
              <br>
              <p class="strong">Simple is efficient.</p><br>
              <p>I tried to make a user flow efficient by creating a multifunctional  screen. However, during user testing, it was clear that I actually overcomplicated it. Not one user knew what to do. I created a new, more simple flow after getting feedback from the users.
